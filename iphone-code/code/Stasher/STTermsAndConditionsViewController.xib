Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Stasher, Inc. on the
collection, use and disclosure of your information on www.stasherapp.com (the “Site”)
and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the
“Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) your
use of the Services generally; and (ii) from third party websites and services. We follow
this privacy policy in accordance with local law in the places where we operate. When
you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation,
storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy
Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal
Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy
Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners
share with us or that we share with our business partners.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or
control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications
(“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals
that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those
Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take
responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We
encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you
access.
What Information Do We Collect?
The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate
the Services. We collect two basic types of information – personal information
and anonymous information - and we may use personal and anonymous information to
create a third type of information, aggregate information. We collect the following
categories of information from those users at least 13 years of age:
• Registration information you provide when you create an account, including your
first name and surname, country and state of residence, gender, date of birth,
email address, username and password
• Transaction information you provide when you register or update your account,
whether on our site or through our application, including your postal address,
phone number, bank account information and payment information.
• Information you provide to us when you use our site and application, or our
application on third-party sites or platforms such social networking sites.
• Location information when you visit our sites or use our application, including
location information either provided by a mobile device interacting with our site or
application, or associated with your IP address, where we are permitted by law to
process this information.
• Usage, viewing and technical data, including your device identifier or IP address,
when you visit our site, use our application on third-party sites or platforms or
open emails we send.
• Third party credentials such as certain passwords, usernames, account numbers,
and other account information for third party sites and services.
• Information from third party sites that we may collect on your behalf so that we
can display information to you through our Services, which includes your account
and other personal information from third party sites that you register under your
account via our Services. For example, if you register your Chase account with
us, we will aggregate your Chase information via our application in order to
present it to you.
Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services. All content
submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even if and after
your access to the Services is terminated. We may continue to disclose such content to
third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this
Privacy Policy.
• Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the
number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate
form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you
personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized
by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can
analyze and improve them.
How Do We Collect Your Information?
• We collect information you provide to us when you request products, services or
information from us, register with us, participate in public forums or other
activities on our site and application, respond to customer surveys, or otherwise
interact with us.
• We collect information through technology, such as cookies, Flash cookies and
Web beacons, including when you visit our site and application or use our
application on third-party sites or platforms.
• We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the
information you provided or we collected automatically. Local law may require
that you authorize the third party to share your information with us before we can
acquire it.
We collect statistical information about how users, collectively, use the Services. Some
of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not
Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, or your web browser.

Please note that once we share your personal information with another company, the
information received by the other company becomes subject to the other company’s
privacy practices:
• When we cooperate with financial institutions to offer co-branded products or

these cases, the financial institutions are prohibited from using your personal

of a business, to enforce our Terms of Use or rules, to ensure the safety and
security of our guests and third parties, to protect our rights and property and the
rights and property of our guests and third parties, to comply with legal process
or in other cases if we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law

Children’s Privacy
We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal
information we may collect from children (users under the age of 13) on our site
and application. When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take
additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:
• Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children,
including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses
to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share
that information
• In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the
collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information
about our products and services directly to their children
• Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is
reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity
• Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we
have collected from their children and the ability to request that the personal
information be changed or deleted
For additional information about our practices regarding children’s personal information,
please read our Children’s Privacy Policy found on our website.
Data Security, Integrity and Retention
The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to
us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that
are designed to protect guest information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use
and modification. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider
appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our 
best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We will retain your
personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now
is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make
changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an
announcement on the Services. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy
when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.
What If I Have Questions or Concerns?
