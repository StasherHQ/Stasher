 Certain operations such as publishing a status or publishing a photo require an audience. When the user
 grants an application permission to perform a publish operation, a default audience is selected as the
 publication ceiling for the application. This enumerated value allows the application to select which
 audience to ask the user to grant publish permission for.

 FBSDKLoginBehavior enum

  Passed to the \c FBSDKLoginManager to indicate how Facebook Login should be attempted.



 Facebook Login authorizes the application to act on behalf of the user, using the user's
 Facebook account. Usually a Facebook Login will rely on an account maintained outside of
 the application, by the native Facebook application, the browser, or perhaps the device
 itself. This avoids the need for a user to enter their username and password directly, and
 provides the most secure and lowest friction way for a user to authorize the application to
 interact with Facebook.

 The \c FBSDKLoginBehavior enum specifies which log-in methods may be used. The SDK
  will determine the best behavior based on the current device (such as iOS version).

  `FBSDKLoginManager` provides methods for logging the user in and out.

 a cached token available (typically in your viewDidLoad).

 "currentAccessToken" before calling logIn* to authorize further permissions on your tokens.
